# ExPlot
A modern Python/Tkinter app to plot data from Excel sheets using *seaborn* and *matplotlib*, featuring beautiful theming with ttkbootstrap. Fully developed with Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Cascade Base, SWE-1, and GPT-4.1 using Windsurf.

# Data structure
Provide an Excel file with one or several sheets for different data sets to be plotted. The data should be in the following format:

| x_category | y_value |  group  |
|------------|---------|---------|
| A          | 1       | Treated |
| A          | 2       | Treated |
| A          | 3       | Treated |
| A          | 8       | Control |
| A          | 6       | Control |
| A          | 7       | Control |
| B          | 14      | Treated |
| B          | 15      | Treated |
| B          | 13      | Treated |
| B          | 21      | Control |
| B          | 22      | Control |
| B          | 21      | Control |

Rows with identical x_categories will be averaged and and used to derive error estimates, or they might be plotted as individual data points. The *group* column can be used to plot data as grouped elements.

The *x_category* column contains the categories to be plotted on the x-axis, the *y_value* column contains the values to be plotted on the y-axis, and the *group* column contains the categories to be used for grouping data.
Alternatively, provide several *y_value* columns, each with a different name.
